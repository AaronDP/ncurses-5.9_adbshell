This is a log of changes that ncurses has gone through since Zeyd started
working with Pavel Curtis' original work, pcurses, in 1992.

Changes through 1.9.9e are recorded by Zeyd M Ben-Halim.
Changes since 1.9.9e are recorded by Thomas E Dickey.

Contributors include those who have provided patches (even small ones), as well
as those who provide useful information (bug reports, analyses).  Changes with
no cited author are the work of Thomas E Dickey (TD).

A few contributors are given in this file by their initials.
They each account for one percent or more of the changes since 1.9.9e.
See the AUTHORS file for the corresponding full names.

Changes through 1.9.9e did not credit all contributions;
it is not possible to add this information.

20110404 5.9 release for upload to ftp.gnu.org

20110402
	+ various build-fixes for the rpm/dpkg scripts.
	+ add "--enable-rpath-link" option to Ada95/configure, to allow
	  packages to suppress the rpath feature which is normally used for
	  the in-tree build of sample programs.
	+ corrected definition of libdir variable in Ada95/src/Makefile.in,
	  needed for rpm script.
	+ add "--with-shared" option to Ada95/configure script, to allow
	  making the C-language parts of the binding use appropriate compiler
	  options if building a shared library with gnat.

20110329
	> portability fixes for Ada95 binding:
	+ add configure check to ensure that SIGINT works with gnat.  This is
	  needed for the "rain" sample program.  If SIGINT does not work, omit
	  that sample program.
	+ correct typo in check of $PKG_CONFIG variable in Ada95/configure
	+ add ncurses_compat.c, to supply functions used in the Ada95 binding
	  which were added in 5.7 and later.
	+ modify sed expression in CF_NCURSES_ADDON to eliminate a dependency
	  upon GNU sed.

20110326
	+ add special check in Ada95/configure script for ncurses6 reentrant
	  code.
	+ regen Ada html documentation.
	+ build-fix for Ada shared libraries versus the varargs workaround.
	+ add rpm and dpkg scripts for Ada95 and test directories, for test
	  builds.
	+ update test/configure macros CF_CURSES_LIBS, CF_XOPEN_SOURCE and
	  CF_X_ATHENA_LIBS.
	+ add configure check to determine if gnat's project feature supports
	  libraries, i.e., collections of .ali files.
	+ make all dereferences in Ada95 samples explicit.
	+ fix typo in comment in lib_add_wch.c (patch by Petr Pavlu).
	+ add configure check for, ifdef's for math.h which is in a separate
	  package on Solaris and potentially not installed (report by Petr
	  Pavlu).
	> fixes for Ada95 binding (Nicolas Boulenguez):
	+ improve type-checking in Ada95 by eliminating a few warning-suppress
	  pragmas.
	+ suppress unreferenced warnings.
	+ make all dereferences in binding explicit.

20110319
	+ regen Ada html documentation.
	+ change order of -I options from ncurses*-config script when the
	  --disable-overwrite option was used, so that the subdirectory include
	  is listed first.
	+ modify the make-tar.sh scripts to add a MANIFEST and NEWS file.
	+ modify configure script to provide value for HTML_DIR in
	  Ada95/gen/Makefile.in, which depends on whether the Ada95 binding is
	  distributed separately (report by Nicolas Boulenguez).
	+ modify configure script to add -g and/or -O3 to ADAFLAGS if the
	  CFLAGS for the build has these options.
	+ amend change from 20070324, to not add 1 to the result of getmaxx
	  and getmaxy in the Ada binding (report by Nicolas Boulenguez for
	  thread in comp.lang.ada).
	+ build-fix Ada95/samples for gnat 4.5
	+ spelling fixes for Ada95/samples/explain.txt
	> fixes for Ada95 binding (Nicolas Boulenguez):
	+ add item in Trace_Attribute_Set corresponding to TRACE_ATTRS.
	+ add workaround for binding to set_field_type(), which uses varargs.
	  The original binding from 990220 relied on the prevalent
	  implementation of varargs which did not support or need va_copy().
	+ add dependency on gen/Makefile.in needed for *-panels.ads
	+ add Library_Options to library.gpr
	+ add Languages to library.gpr, for gprbuild

20110307
	+ revert changes to limit-checks from 20110122 (Debian #616711).
	> minor type-cleanup of Ada95 binding (Nicolas Boulenguez):
	+ corrected a minor sign error in a field of Low_Level_Field_Type, to
	  conform to form.h.
	+ replaced C_Int by Curses_Bool as return type for some callbacks, see
	  fieldtype(3FORM).
	+ modify samples/sample-explain.adb to provide explicit message when
	  explain.txt is not found.

20110305
	+ improve makefiles for Ada95 tree (patch by Nicolas Boulenguez).
	+ fix an off-by-one error in _nc_slk_initialize() from 20100605 fixes
	  for compiler warnings (report by Nicolas Boulenguez).
	+ modify Ada95/gen/gen.c to declare unused bits in generated layouts,
	  needed to compile when chtype is 64-bits using gnat 4.4.5

20110226 5.8 release for upload to ftp.gnu.org

20110226
	+ update release notes, for 5.8.
	+ regenerated html manpages.
	+ change open() in _nc_read_file_entry() to fopen() for consistency
	  with write_file().
	+ modify misc/run_tic.in to create parent directory, in case this is
	  a new install of hashed database.
	+ fix typo in Ada95/mk-1st.awk which causes error with original awk.

20110220
	+ configure script rpath fixes from xterm #269.
	+ workaround for cygwin's non-functional features.h, to force ncurses'
	  configure script to define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED when building
	  wide-character configuration.
	+ build-fix in run_tic.sh for OS/2 EMX install
	+ add cons25-debian entry (patch by Brian M Carlson, Debian #607662).

20110212
	+ regenerated html manpages.
	+ use _tracef() in show_where() function of tic, to work correctly with
	  special case of trace configuration. 

20110205
	+ add xterm-utf8 entry as a demo of the U8 feature -TD
	+ add U8 feature to denote entries for terminal emulators which do not
	  support VT100 SI/SO when processing UTF-8 encoding -TD
	+ improve the NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS feature by adding a check for an
	  extended terminfo capability U8 (prompted by mailing list
	  discussion).

20110122
	+ start documenting interface changes for upcoming 5.8 release.
	+ correct limit-checks in derwin().
	+ correct limit-checks in newwin(), to ensure that windows have nonzero
	  size (report by Garrett Cooper).
	+ fix a missing "weak" declaration for pthread_kill (patch by Nicholas
	  Alcock).
	+ improve documentation of KEY_ENTER in curs_getch.3x manpage (prompted
	  by discussion with Kevin Martin).

20110115
	+ modify Ada95/configure script to make the --with-curses-dir option
	  work without requiring the --with-ncurses option.
	+ modify test programs to allow them to be built with NetBSD curses.
	+ document thick- and double-line symbols in curs_add_wch.3x manpage.
	+ document WACS_xxx constants in curs_add_wch.3x manpage.
	+ fix some warnings for clang 2.6 "--analyze"
	+ modify Ada95 makefiles to make html-documentation with the project
	  file configuration if that is used.
	+ update config.guess, config.sub

20110108
	+ regenerated html manpages.
	+ minor fixes to enable lint when trace is not enabled, e.g., with
	  clang --analyze.
	+ fix typo in man/default_colors.3x (patch by Tim van der Molen).
	+ update ncurses/llib-lncurses*

20110101
	+ fix remaining strict compiler warnings in ncurses library ABI=5,
	  except those dealing with function pointers, etc.
